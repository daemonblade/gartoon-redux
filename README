===Installation===

There are four options:

a) Use the Debian installer. You will be able to change the theme
   to Gartoon Redux in root applications then. Run:
      gksu gnome-appearance-properties
   and set the theme  for the root user to Gartoon Redux.
b) Drag the .tar.gz archive onto the Appearance Properties window.
c) Unpack the archive to ~/.icons/GartoonRedux.
d) Get the source archive and create your own package. See below for details.

Additionally, there are stock icons for some applications which need
modifying your gtkrc file. Open the file named .gtkrc-2.0 in your home
directory (if it doesn't exist, create it) and put this line at the end:

   include "/path/to/gtkrc"
   
where /path/to/gtkrc is the path to this package's gtkrc file. If you
installed using the Debian installer, it will be:

   include "/usr/share/icons/GartoonRedux/gtkrc"
   
If you dragged the tar package on the Appearance window, it will be:
   
   include "/home/<your username>/.icons/GartoonRedux/gtkrc"
   
Currently, this will enable Gartoon Redux icons in GVim and GThumb. Support
for other applications like GIMP is planned.


===Building from source===
   
Gartoon Redux is also distributed as source (that means, SVG only + a set
of scripts that take care or generating the rendered versions). To build it,
you will need the "rsvg" executable from librsvg (librsv2-bin package
in Debian), and Perl to run the configure script. Go to the directory where
you unpacked the source package and run:

   ./configure
   make
   make install
   
The last command needs to be run as root. This will install the icons into
/usr/local/share/icons/GartoonRedux.

===F.A.Q===

Q: Why should this theme be better than the original Gartoon?
A: It has over 500 new icons, and countless symlinks to make the icons
   show up in most applications. There are also some symlinks for desktop
   environments other than Gnome.
   
Q: One of my applications is unthemed. How do I fix that?
A: There are two common causes.
   1. There are no icons for your application. You need to find out the names
      and create them. This may require looking at the source code. You can
      also send an e-mail to the theme author instead of doing it yourself.
   2. The application doesn't support theming or uses the theme mechanism
      in a non-standard way. Some common examples are OpenOffice.org and
      Firefox 2. Also, some launchers use fixed icon paths. You can edit
      the .desktop files in /usr/share/applications to find out (you need to
      do it via the Open menu of your text editor, because opening them in
      Nautilus runs the corresponding application.

Q: What is Gartoon Redux's License?
A: It is lincensed under the GNU General Public License (read COPYING).

Q: Why GPL? It's not like Gartoon Redux is a program!
A: Gartoon Redux contains both SVG images and their PNG renders.
   The intended interpretation is that the SVG images constitute the source
   code. This means that if you distribute a modified version of Gartoon Redux,
   the vector versions of all the icons must also be made available.

Q: Can I make a modified version of this theme?
A: Yes, you can. You can also distribute it, provided that you also make
   the vector versions of all the icons publicly available, either as
   a separate download or include them in the theme.
   
Q: I want to create a Gartoon-style icon. How do I do that?
A: First, look at the existing icons to get a feel of the style. To edit SVG,
   You will need Inkscape. I recommend acquainting yourself with its
   capabilities first. You should be familiar with at least the node tool,
   gradient fills, strokes, boolean operations on paths, object to path, text
   tools, dynamic offset and clones. I recommend using the latest SVN version,
   which has a clipboard that works across different instances. New icons should
   be 90x90 pixels. You should use the Gartoon palette, found in the extras
   directory - copy it to ~/.inkscape/palettes (create that dir if it doesn't
   exist). To select the palette, click the tiny arrow at the right edge
   of the palette bar and select Gartoon from the list.
   It takes some time to master the Gartoon style. Its key elements are:
   1. Smooth gradients.
   2. Thick dark outline with a color matching the foreground, or black. Look
      for a compromise between contrast and color consistency. You can create it
      easily by unioning all foreground shapes and then applying a dynamic
      offset. However, you will need to tweak the sharp corners.
   3. Background shadow, black with alpha=75, often a copy of the outline.
   4. Simplified depiction of real-world objects.
   5. Dynamic perspectives.
   6. Reuse of existing elements like arrows, pencil, padlock, etc.
   7. Gartoon palette, with other colors (notably purple) used only where
      really necessary.
   8. Solid white (or trans-white to opaque-white gradient) highlights on items
      intended to look glossy.
   Once you create the icon, check whether it's rendered correctly by librsvg,
   e.g. whether the preview in Nautilus looks like what you created in Inkscape.
   If you use advanced SVG features, you may run into rendering errors with
   librsvg, and your icons will display incorrectly.
